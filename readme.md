Hello :)

This is some kind of Tic Tac Toe Game :)

I added functionality if it's tie to display alert about it.

I'm still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on Kenny Yip Coding YouTube channel,
and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Also, I done it with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
